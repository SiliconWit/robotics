# Robotics Fundamentals with Interactive Demonstrations

## Overview

This repository provides interactive demonstrations and educational tools for learning fundamental robotics concepts. Through practical implementations, we explore the mathematical foundations and programming techniques essential for understanding robotic systems. Each module is designed to illustrate key concepts such as quaternion-based rotations, forward kinematics, Jacobian matrices, and robotic arm control.

## Core Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Quaternion-Based Rotations
- Implementation of quaternion mathematics for smooth 3D rotations
- Conversion between different rotation representations (quaternions, matrices, Euler angles)
- Avoiding gimbal lock and ensuring numerical stability in rotation operations
- Composition of rotations using quaternion multiplication

### 2. Forward Kinematics
- Computing end-effector positions from joint angles
- Propagating rotations through kinematic chains
- Implementing Denavit-Hartenberg transformations
- Visualizing the workspace of robotic manipulators

### 3. Jacobian Matrix Calculations
- Relating joint velocities to end-effector velocities
- Analyzing manipulability and singularities
- Computing condition numbers for assessing manipulator performance
- Using the Jacobian for robot control applications

### 4. 3D Visualization and Simulation
- Real-time visualization of robot arm movements
- Path tracing for end-effector trajectories
- Interactive joint control and animation
- Frame capture for educational animations
